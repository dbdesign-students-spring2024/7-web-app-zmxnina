## App Details 
The title of my app is **Be Na's Guest**. It is a simple reservation management application for Izakaya Nana, a made-up Japanese restaurant.

This app is designed to enhance the dining experience by providing customers and restaurant staff with an intuitive interface for managing dining logistics. Below is an overview of the application's main features and functionalities:

1. Restaurant Menu: 

    A feature that allows the users to browse through a detailed menu prior to their visit.

    A dedicated management portal for restaurant staff, providing tools to create, read, update, and delete all reservations and table abilities in real-time. It supports restaurant operations by allowing staff to adjust reservations based on customer requests and restaurant capacity.

## Deployment
Unfortunately, despite troubleshooting efforts, I was still unable to resolve the persistent 500 server error and deploy my application on the [i6 server](https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~mz2958/7-web-app-zmxnina/flask.cgi).

I have sent in a copy of my .env file through my private channel on discord for local testing.
