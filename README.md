## App Details 
The title of my app is **Be Na's Guest**. It is a simple reservation management application for Izakaya Nana, a made-up Japanese restaurant. 

The app is designed to enhance the dining experience by providing customers and restaurant staff with an intuitive interface for managing dining logistics. Below is an overview of the application's main features and functionalities:

1. Restaurant Menu: 

    A feature that allows the users to browse through a detailed menu prior to their visit.

2. Reservation Availability: 

    A real-time reservation system that enables users to book tables easily. It displays current table availabilities and allows reservations to be made for any available date and time. 

3. Administrative Portal:

    A dedicated management portal for restaurant staff, providing tools to create, read, update, and delete all reservations and table abilities in real-time. It supports restaurant operations by allowing staff to adjust reservations based on customer requests and restaurant capacity.

    To access the portal, staff members must login with the correct credentials,
    Username: **admin** <br/> Password: **adminpass**
